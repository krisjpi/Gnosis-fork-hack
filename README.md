# Gnosis-fork-hack
A repo pulling together our theory, design, and progress made on our Gnosis Conditional Token hack for Fork the World. We attempted to add futarchy in our operational decision making for our DAO.

Aim:
To integrate the Gnosis Conditional Token Framework (CTF) into an Aragon DAO structured around our EthDenver project CastleDAO (https://devfolio.co/submissions/castle-dao and https://github.com/johnkozan/housing-dao). 

Integrating the CTF served as a multipurpose solution for several issues that still existed in our original project design.
        1. There was little use for the token besides buying and selling on the bonding curve.
            - Integrating a Conditional Token with the collateral being the housing token both adds functionality to the token and ensures that participants in the governance are active holders of the housing token already.
        2. There was little incentive for token holders to be active in the governance process at all.
            - By adding the conditional tokens as a governance mechanism, token holders are incentivised to participate in the governance process.
        3. There were no measures to ensure that token holders who did engage in governance processes were incentivized toward good governance outside of the overall value of the token.
            -  Adding conditional tokens also allows governance participatns to be rewarded for engaging in good governance, while pruning the holdings of those who consistently perform poorly in the governance market.


System Design:
We hoped to deploy an Aragon DAO on Rinkeby and install the CTF as an app.



Example Conditional Questions:



Progress:
Because this hack focused on the futarchy aspect of the DAO, we opted for deploying a fundraising DAO with a fairly standard Bancor curve, and looked into installing an app.
